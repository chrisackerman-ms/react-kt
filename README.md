# React KT: Part 1

Simple React projects, created by hand (not using `create-react-app`), without using TypeScript (yet).

Q: Why not use `create-react-app`?
A: By all means, do use it if you feel you need it. But, the purpose of this project is to teach all the nuts and bolts
so that when you do use a project creation tool like `create-react-app`, you will know what it is doing. It might also
demonstrate that such a tool might be more trouble than it's worth.

## Goal

Include dependencies, configure build tools, and run a simple application in a local development server.

## Tools

* NPM
* Webpack
* Webpack Dev Server
* Babel

## Configuration Files

* `package.json` (NPM)
* `webpack.config.js` (Webpack, Webpack Dev Server)
* `babel.config.js` (Babel)
* `.browserslistrc`
  * See https://browserl.ist to see exactly which browsers are being targetted.

## Conventions

* Source is contained in the `src/` directory.
* Bundle files are output to the `dist/` directory.
